# Lumere Coding Test
Private repository for a coding test for Lumere.  This repository only consists of code that is functional for task no. 1 from the Lumere test directions.  At the time of this writing and submission, task no. 2 has not yet been completed.  Task no. 2 can be developed and completed upon request as well.

## **Repository Directions**

Request collaborative access to this repo and download a copy.  Navigate to to this directory:

        cd lumere-coding-test

Install all dependencies (this repo uses Node.js so please make sure your machine is set up to run npm):

        npm install

Once everything is installed simnply run the command:

        node app.js

Once you run this command, you will see a file called "data-output.csv" as well as an output in the terminal with results from task no. 1.  Some of the code has also been commented for additional insight into my thought process.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
