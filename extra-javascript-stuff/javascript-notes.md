# **JavaScript Notes**

Common JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript has six primitive data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol.

## **Boolean**

Booleans are standard across all programming languages. A Boolean data type represents only one of two values: true or false.

Developers use a Boolean to represent the current state of something that is likely to change. For example, you can use a Boolean to show whether a checkbox is checked or not:

    var isChecked = true;

## **Null**

null is a special value that explicitly represents "nothing" or something that does not exist. For example, this code states that age is unknown or empty.

    let age = null;

## **Undefined**
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”. A variable can be declared but not assigned a value:

    var n;
    alert(n); // shows "undefined"

What's the difference between null and undefined?
The main distinction is that null is an assigned value -- an intentionally empty value. undefined means that there is a variable declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.

## **Number**

Number is a numeric data type. As you learned earlier, numbers can be written with or without a decimal point.

You can perform different operations with numbers, like multiplication *, division /, addition +, and subtraction -.

## **String**

A String is a grouping of characters used to represent text. Strings must be inside of either double " or ' single quotes. For example:

    const author = "Ursula K Le Guin";
    const book = 'A Wizard of Earthsea';

## **Symbol**

Symbol is a new data type in ES2015 that represents a unique identifier. You can read more about this new data type in the MDN docs.

Use the typeof operator to see which data type is stored in a variable.
For example:

    let name = "Alena Holligan";
    alert(typeof name); // returns "string"

    let score = 150;
    alert(typeof score); // returns "number"

    let x;
    alert(typeof x); // returns "undefined"

## **let and const**

ES2015 introduced two new keywords for declaring variables: const and let. Both work similarly to var. You use the keyword -- const or let -- and a value you want to put into the variable:

    let message = "Hello";
    const pi = 3.14159;
    let score = 0;

const is short for constant, meaning that the value of the variable shouldn't change -- it should remain "constant". const protects a variable from being overwritten by any stray assignments in your code. In other words, once you create a constant you can't give it another value. For example:

    const myName = 'Guil';

// this will throw an error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
myName = 'James';

The let keyword is used when you want to reassign a variable. In that respect, it works like var. For example, we can update the values of age and isHungry:

    let age = 43;
    let isHungry = true;

    age = 44;
    isHungry = false;

But we cannot redefine a let variable within the same context or scope.

    let age = 43;
    let isHungry = true;

    let age = 44; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'age' has already been declared
    let isHungry = false; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'isHungry' has already been declared

When should you use const, and when should use you let?
const is your first option when declaring variables. It helps prevent reassignment bugs and help you debug your code faster. let is a great substitute for var when you're wanting to reassign a value.

# **JavaScript Frameworks**

## **Client-Side UI**

The following produce the DOM client side.

- React.js / React Native

- Vue.js

- Angular.js

## **Server Side UI**

UI frameworks that allow for predefined server setups.

- Next.js

- Nuxt.js
    - Works well with Vue.js

- Angular Universal

# **JavaScript Unit Tests**

- Mocha

- Jasmine (Best for Angular)

- Jest (Good for React)

- Enzyme
