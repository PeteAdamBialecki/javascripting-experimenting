    <h1>JavaScript Concepts</h1>
    <caption>Global and Local Scope</caption>
    <p>Last lesson we learned that when we write code in a browser it becomes a part of the <em>global </em> window object. Almost all the code we have written up until this point has been global. When something is global it means all code can access, change, and use it.  This means we have to be very careful about creating anything that is global in <em>scope</em> so we don't accidentally do something we didn't intend. </p>
    <p>When we create a variable inside of a function it can't be accessed from code outside of the function.  Why?  Because it's scope is <em>local</em> to that function, meaning it is invisible to any other code other than the other code inside of that function.
    </p>
    <caption>Understanding Scope</caption>
    <p>By understanding code's <em>scope</em>, we know when that code affects only one part of our code, or the entire codebase.  If we create things that are <em>global</em> in scope, we are giving any code the supreme power to control our code.   So we want to protect our code by being very careful when creating things that are global in scope. This is especially important if you plan on using JavaScript libraries like jQuery.</p>
  <caption>Local Scope</caption>
  <p>JavaScript uses <em>function scope</em>, meaning every time we create a new function the scope changes.  Any code inside that function is <em>local</em> to that function. Code that is local in scope is not accessible to outside code.</p>
