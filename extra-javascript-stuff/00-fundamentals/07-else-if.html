    <p>FizzBuzz is a common coding exercise that is well known as a coding question asked in interviews that is designed to filter out candidates.</p>
    <p>Let's try a modified version of FizzBuzz with If/Else and see if we can do it:</p>
    <p><em>Generate a random number between 0 and 5.  If the result is divisible by 3 alert "fizz".  If the number is divisible by 5, alert "buzz", otherwise print the number to the console (the JavaScript code can be seen in the console).</em></p>

<script>
    var randomNumber = Math.round( Math.random() * 5);

    if ( randomNumber%3 === 0 ) {
        alert("fizz");
    } else if (randomNumber%5 === 0) {
        alert("buzz")
    } else {
        console.log(randomNumber)
    }
</script>
