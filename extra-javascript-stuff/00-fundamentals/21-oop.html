        <p>CREATING OBJECTS</p>
        - Object Literal: One instance of a single obect.
        <br>
        - Object Constructor: Creates a prototype that can be used to define multiple instances of objects.</p>
        <p>UNDERSTANDING OBJECTS</p>
        <p>There are three main categories fo objects: <em>Host Objects</em>, <em>Core Objects</em>, and <em>Objects defined by the code's author</em>.
        <br>
        - <em>Host objects</em> are objects defined by the enviornment in which your code is run.
        <br>
        - A <em>web browser</em> is an example of a host enviornment. Some objects defined by the browser include: Document, Window, Element, Event, Node, Comment, Console.
        <br>
        - <em>Core objects</em> are objects defined by and built into the JavaScript language itself: Math, Object, String, Boolean, Array, Date, and Number.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript uses <em>objects</em> as a way of passing around and sharing code and functionality. When we create variables, functions, and objects, they are properties of the <em>global object</em>. 
        </p>
         <p>The <em>window</em> is the <em>global object</em> when the host environment is the web.  When we write a function that isn't associated with an object, it becomes a method of the global object.  E.g. if we write a function called sayHello(), we can also use the method window.sayHello().  </p>
