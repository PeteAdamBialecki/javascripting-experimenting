        <caption>Variables</caption>
        <p><em>Variables</em> allow us to store a reference to a value to be referred to later or "remembered." When we create a new variable, we are <em>declaring</em> it, which means our code now recognizes it as a "thing." Variables are created using the <em>var</em> keyword.  Variable names cannot start with a number, contain spaces, or use a word that is already reserved for something else.  It also cannot use any punctuation expect "_" or "$".</p>
