# **JavaScript Best Practices: Production Code**

## **NPM Settings**

Here are a few helpful steps to get started with Node:

- cd into your working directory and run to create your package.json:

        npm init

- Add this to package.json to limit what kind of versions of Node should be used by the user...

            "engines":{
        "node": "4.2.1"

- Run this to prevent using --save when installing (then install npm package):

        npm config set save=true

- If you run this, you elimnate the possibilities of using " ^ " in package versions so it is more stable (run this command before installing packages):

        npm config set save-exact=true

## **Enviornment Variables**

- Step #1: Run this first:

        npm install -g foreman

- Step #2: Edit scripts section of package.json:

        {
            "name": "04-production-code",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "description": "A sample project for notes on production code.",
            "main": "app.js",
            "scripts": {
                "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
                    "start": "node app.js"
            },
            "author": "Pete Adam Bialecki",
            "license": "ISC",
            "engines": {
                "node": "4.2.1"
            },
            "dependencies": {
                "express": "4.16.4",
                "passport": "0.4.0"
            }
        }

- Step #3: run nf start

- Step #4: Create ".env" file with a sample of the following code:

        {
            "port": 9000,
            "connection": {
                "sql": "",
                "mongo": ""
            }
        }

- Step #5: now run 

        nf start

...and the port should now be 9000 and other settings.

## **Cross Platform Concerns**

- When naming files in a directory, do not use camel case because Windows, Linux, and Mac all read files different.  For example, 'myObject.js' is the same as 'myobject.js' on Mac whereas other systems may read them strict.  Get in the habit of naming files like 'my-object.js'.
