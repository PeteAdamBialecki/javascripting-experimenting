# **JavaScript Design Patterns: Structural Design Patters**

Concerned with how ovjects are made up and simplify relationships between objects.

- Deal with the relationship of objects.

- Extend functionality.

- Simplify functionlity.

## **Decorator Patterns**

Used to add new functionlity to an existing object, without being obtrusive.

- More complete inheritance

- Wraps an object

- Protects existing objects

- Allows extended functionlity

## ***Facade Patterns**

Used to provide a simplified interface to a complicated system (e.g. jQuery).

- Think about the front of a building nice on the front but chaos behind on the backend.

- Simplifies the interface.

## **Flyweight Pattern**

Conserves memory by sharing portions of an object between objects.

- Ou tasks had lots of non unique data

- Flyweight shares data across objects

- Results in a smaller memory footprint

- Like a boxer ---- a flyweight...

- But only if you have large numbers of objects
